Here is a `README.md` file for your project to help users set up and run your NPM project:

```markdown
# Project Name

This is a web application built with React, React Router, and various components like `MainLayout`, `LoginCard`, and `DashboardLayout`. The project uses the `react-router-dom` package to manage routes for the main page and the dashboard for students, alumni, and colleges.

## Features

- Main layout with login functionality
- Dashboard for Students, Alumni, and Colleges (Commented sections included for expansion)
- Modular routing for easy updates and scalability

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   To start the development server, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The project should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- `/src/routes/Router.jsx`: Defines the application routes.
- `/src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx`: Contains the main layout structure.
- `/src/components/Dashboard/Login/LoginCard.jsx`: The login component.
- `/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx`: Student dashboard page.

The other components like Alumni and College dashboards are commented out for future use.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`**: Runs the app in the development mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run start`**: Starts the production build of the app.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints your code to ensure best practices.

## Customizing the Routes

The project uses `react-router-dom` for routing. You can modify or add routes in the `Router.jsx` file. Un-comment and expand the routes as needed for Alumni and College dashboards.

Example:

```javascript
{
    path: "alumni",
    element: <AlumniDashboard />,
    children: [
        {
            path: "profile",
            element: <AlumniProfile />
        }
    ]
}
```
